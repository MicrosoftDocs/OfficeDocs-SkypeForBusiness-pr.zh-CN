# New-CsSipProxyTLS

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2015-03-09_

Creates a new SipProxy.TLS object, which can then be used to configure a static route to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) as its transport protocol. 此 cmdlet 是在 Lync Server 2010 中引入的。

## 语法

    New-CsSipProxyTLS -Certificate <ITLSTLSChoice> -Fqdn <String>

## Examples

## EXAMPLE 1

The commands shown in Example 1 create a new SIP proxy transport object that uses TLS as its transport. Because TLS requires a certificate to be used for authentication purposes, the first command in the example uses the **New-CsSipProxyUseDefaultCert** cmdlet to configure a new SipProxy.UseDefaultCert. This object, stored in a variable named $cert, instructs Lync Server to use the default certificate for the TLS transport. After the UseDefaultCert object has been created, the **New-CsSipProxyTLS** cmdlet can be called to create a new SipProxy.TLS object, one that uses the default certificate and points to atl-proxy-001.litwareinc.com as the FQDN of the next hop server.

As soon as the TLS object exists, that object (and the TLS protocol) can be added to a Transport object, an object created by calling the **New-CsSipProxyTransport** cmdlet.

    $cert = New-CsSipProxyUseDefaultCert
    
    $tls = New-CsSipProxyTLS -Certificate $cert -Fqdn atl-proxy-001.litwareinc.com
    
    $transport = New-CsSipProxyTransport -TransportChoice $tls -Port 7500

## Detailed Description

When you send a SIP message to someone, that message might need to traverse multiple subnets and networks before it is delivered; the path traveled by the message is often referred to as a route. In networking, there are two types of routes: dynamic and static. With dynamic routing, servers use algorithms to determine the next location (the next hop) where a message should be forwarded. With static routing, message paths are predetermined by system administrators. When a message is received by a server, the server checks the message address and then forwards the message to the next hop server that has been preconfigured by an administrator. If configured correctly, static routes help ensure timely, and accurate, delivery of messages, and with minimal overheard placed on servers. The downside to static routes is that messages are not dynamically rerouted in the event of a network failure.

Lync Server enables you to set up static routes for proxy servers. These routes are composed of two primary pieces: proxy configuration settings and SIP proxy routes. In turn, SIP proxy routes have a number of properties; for example, each route must have a Transport, a property that defines the network protocol used for transmitting messages along the route.

Lync Server allows you to specify either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) as your transport protocol. If you decide to use TLS as your protocol, you must first create a TLS object by using the **New-CsSipProxyTLS** cmdlet. You can then use that object to specify the protocol for the Transport object created by the **New-CsSipProxyTransport** cmdlet.

Note that you must also specify a certificate (to be used for authentication purposes) if you choose to use TLS as your transport protocol.

The **New-CsSipProxyTLS** cmdlet is not required if you use the **New-CsStaticRoute** cmdlet to create your static route.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **New-CsSipProxyTLS** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$\_.Cmdlets –match "New-CsSipProxyTLS"}

## Input Types

None. The **New-CsSipProxyTLS** cmdlet does not accept pipelined input.

## Return Types

The **New-CsSipProxyTLS** cmdlet creates new instances of the Microsoft.Rtc.Management.WritableConfig.Settings.SipProxy.TLS object.
