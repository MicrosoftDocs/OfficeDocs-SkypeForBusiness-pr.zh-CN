# Remove-CsMcxConfiguration

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2015-03-09_

Removes the specified collection of Lync Server 2013 Mobility Service configuration settings. The Mobility Service enables users of mobile phones such as iPhones and Windows Phones to do such things as exchange instant messages and presence information; store and retrieve voice mail internally instead of with their wireless provider; and take advantage of Lync Server capabilities such as Call via Work and dial-out conferencing. 此 cmdlet 是在 2011 年 11 月版的 Lync Server 2010 累积更新中引入的。

## 语法

    Remove-CsMcxConfiguration -Identity <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

## Examples

## EXAMPLE 1

The command shown in Example 1 deletes the collection of Mobility Service configuration settings assigned to the Redmond site.

    Remove-CsMcxConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

## EXAMPLE 2

In Example 2, all the Mobility Service configuration settings assigned to the service scope are removed. To do this, the **Get-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet is used along with the Filter parameter; the filter value "service:\*" ensures that only settings that have an Identity that begins with the string value "service:" will be returned. That filtered collection is then piped to, and deleted by, the **Remove-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet.

    Get-CsMcxConfiguration -Filter "service:*" | Remove-CsMcxConfiguration

## EXAMPLE 3

Example 3 deletes all the Mobility Service configuration settings where the ExposedWebURL property has been set to Internal. To perform this task, the command first calls the **Get-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the Mobility Service configuration settings currently in use in the organization. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where ExposedWebURL is equal to (-eq) Internal. In turn, that filtered collection is piped to the **Remove-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet, which deletes each item in that filtered collection.

    Get-CsMcxConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.ExposedWebURL -eq "Internal"} | Remove-CsMcxConfiguration

## EXAMPLE 4

In Example 4, all the Mobility Service configuration settings that do not have an assigned push notification proxy URI are removed from Lync Server. To do this, the command first uses the **Get-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet (without any parameters) to return a collection of all the Mobility Service configuration settings currently in use. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which picks out any settings where the PushNotificationProxyUri property is equal to (-eq) a Null value. Any settings that meet that criterion are then piped to, and deleted by, the **Remove-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet.

    Get-CsMcxConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.PushNotificationProxyUri -eq $Null} | Remove-CsMcxConfiguration

## Detailed Description

The Mobility Service extends many of the capabilities of Lync Server to mobile devices such as Apple iPhones, Windows Phone, Android phones, and Nokia phones. Among other things, users can use these phones to exchange instant message and presence information, and to receive notifications of new voice mails. Thanks to the push notification service (Apple Push Notification Service and Microsoft Push Notification Service), users with iPhones or Windows Phones can receive these notifications even if Lync is running in the background. The Mobility Service also provides the opportunity for organizations to enable Call via Work. With Call via Work, users can make a call from their mobile phone and have it appear as though the call originated from their work phone; for example, Caller ID systems will display the user's work number instead of his or her mobile phone number.

The Mobility Service itself is managed by using Mobility Service configuration settings that can be applied to the global scope, the site scope, or the service scope (for the Web server service only). These settings control such things as the maximum length of time for a Mobility Service session; whether or not the Autodiscovery Service (which directs Mobility Service users to the appropriate Registrar pool) is available to users who log on outside the organization's firewall); and the location of the push notification service provider.

When you install Lync Server, a single collection of Mobility Service configuration settings is created at the global scope; however, administrators can create custom configuration settings at either the site or the service scope. Later, these custom settings can be removed by using the **Remove-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet. If you remove service settings, Mobility Service servers formerly managed by those settings will be managed by the site settings (if they exist) or by the global settings. If you remove site settings, servers will be managed by the global settings.

Note that you can also run the **Remove-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet against the global settings. If you do that, however, the global settings will not be removed. Instead, the properties in the global collection will simply be reset to their default values.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **Remove-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
