# Get-CsClsConfiguration

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2015-03-09_

Returns information about the centralized logging configuration settings in use in the organization. Centralized logging provides a way for administrators to simultaneously enable or disable event tracing on multiple computers. 此 cmdlet 是在 Lync Server 2013 中引入的。

## 语法

    Get-CsClsConfiguration [-Identity <XdsIdentity>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

    Get-CsClsConfiguration [-Filter <String>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

    COMMON PARAMETERS: [-LocalStore <SwitchParameter>]

## Examples

## Example 1

The command shown in Example 1 returns information about all the centralized logging configuration settings currently in use in the organization.

    Get-CsClsConfiguration

## Example 2

In Example 2, information is returned for a single collection of centralized logging configuration settings: the collection applied to the Redmond site.

    Get-CsClsConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond"

## Example 3

Example 3 shows detailed information for the centralized logging scenarios available to the Redmond site. In order to do this, the command first retrieves all the centralized logging property values for the Redmond site. Those property values are then piped to the Select-Object cmdlet, which uses the ExpandProperty parameter to "expand" the values found in the Scenarios property. When you expand a property you simply display all the information stored in that property in an easy-to-read fashion.

    Get-CsClsConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Scenarios

## Example 4

In Example 4, information is returned for all the centralizing logging configuration settings where the ETL file rollover interval is greater than 1 hour. To carry out this task, the command first calls the **Get-CsClsConfiguration** cmdlet without any parameters; this returns a collection of all the centralized logging configuration settings in the organization. That collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the EtlFileRolloverMinutes property is greater than (-gt) 60 minutes.

    Get-CsClsConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.EtlFileRolloverMinutes -gt 60}

## Example 5

The command shown in Example 5 is similar to the command shown in Example 4; in this case, however, information is returned only for those centralized logging configuration settings that include a "HybridVoice" scenario. To do this, the command first uses the **Get-CsClsConfiguration** cmdlet to return a collection of all the centralized logging configuration settings. That collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which selects only those settings that have at least one scenario where the Name property includes (-match) the string value "HybridVoice".

    Get-CsClsConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.Scenarios.Name -match "HybridVoice"}

## Detailed Description

The centralized logging service (which replaces the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools used in Microsoft Lync Server 2010) provides a way for administrators to manage logging and tracing for all computers and pools running Lync Server 2013. Centralized logging enables administrators to stop, start, and configure logging for one or more pools and computers by using a single command; for example, you can use one command to enable Address Book service logging on all your Address Book servers. This differs from the OCSLogger and OCSTracer tools, which had to be individually managed (including individually stopped and started) on each server. In addition, the centralized logging service also provides a way for administrators to search trace logs from the command, using the Windows PowerShell 命令行接口 and the [Search-CsClsLogging](search-csclslogging.md) cmdlet.

Centralized logging is built around a series of predefined scenarios that offer a more finely-targeted approach to logging than offered in previous versions of Lync Server. These scenarios predetermine the server components and logging for you; as a result, an administrator enabling the RGS scenario can be confident that he or she will only log information relevant to the Response Group service and not to, say, the audio conferencing provider service.

It is also possible to define custom scenarios by using the [New-CsClsScenario](new-csclsscenario.md) cmdlet.

Centralized logging is managed by using collections of centralized logging service configuration settings. When you install Microsoft Lync Server 2013, you install a global set of these configuration settings; in addition, administrators can add custom settings collections at the site scope. The **Get-CsClsConfiguration** cmdlet enables administrators to return information about all the central logging configuration settings currently in use in the organization.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$\_.Cmdlets –match "Get-CsClsConfiguration"}

**Lync Server 控制面板:** The functions carried out by the **Get-CsClsConfiguration** cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server 控制面板.
