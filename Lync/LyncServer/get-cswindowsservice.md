# Get-CsWindowsService

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2015-03-09_

**Get-CsWindowsService** returns detailed information about Lync Server components that run as Windows services. 此 cmdlet 是在 Lync Server 2010 中引入的。

## 语法

    Get-CsWindowsService [-ComputerName <String>] [-ExcludeActivityLevel <SwitchParameter>] [-Name <String>] [-Report <String>]

## Examples

## EXAMPLE 1

The command shown in Example 1 returns information about all the Lync Server services installed on the local computer. This is done by calling the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet without any parameters.

    Get-CsWindowsService

## EXAMPLE 2

Example 2 also returns information about the Lync Server services on the local computer; in this case, however, the data is displayed in list format. (Among other things, this enables you to view all the property values for each service. In the default, tabular view, only a subset of property values is displayed.) To carry out this task, the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet is first called, then the resulting information is piped to the **Format-List** cmdlet.

    Get-CsWindowsService | Format-List

## EXAMPLE 3

Example 3 returns information for a single Lync Server service: the service with the name RTCSrv.

    Get-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCSrv"

## EXAMPLE 4

In Example 4, detailed information is displayed for all the service roles handled by the RTCSrv service. To perform this task, the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet is first used to return information about the RTCSrv service. This information is then piped to the **Select-Object** cmdlet, which uses the ExpandProperty parameter to display all the roles handled by the RTCSrv service. Note that this command will return an error message if a service does not have a role name.

    Get-CsWindowsService -Name "RTCSrv" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty RoleName

## EXAMPLE 5

The command shown in Example 5 returns information about the Lync Server services installed on the remote computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com. This is done by including the ComputerName parameter followed by the FQDN of the remote computer.

    Get-CsWindowsService -Computer atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

## EXAMPLE 6

Example 6 returns information about all the Lync Server services installed on the local computer. In addition, the Report parameter is included in order to save error information to a file named C:\\Logs\\Services.html. If the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet encounters any problems in retrieving service data, information about that problem will be recorded in Services.html.

    Get-CsWindowsService -Report C:\Logs\Services.html

## EXAMPLE 7

In Example 7, information is returned only for the Lync Server services on the local computer that are currently running. To accomplish this, the command first calls the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet to return a collection of all the Lync Server services, running or not running. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which picks out only those services where the Status property is equal to Running.

    Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"}

## EXAMPLE 8

Example 8 shows how you can retrieve information for a particular service even if you do not know the actual name of that service (in this case, RTCASMCU). To perform this task, the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet is first called without any parameters; that returns a collection of all the Lync Server services on the local computer. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which selects the one service where the DisplayName property includes (-like) the string value "Application Sharing". The end result: information is displayed for the Lync Server 应用程序共享会议服务.

    Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Application Sharing*"}

## EXAMPLE 9

Example 9 returns information about any services that host the Application Server role. To do this, the command first calls the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet to return a collection of all the Lync Server services on the local computer. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which selects those services where the RoleName property includes (-contains) ApplicationServer.

    Get-CsWindowsService | Where-Object {$_.RoleName -contains "ApplicationServer"}

## Detailed Description

Many Lync Server components run as standard Windows services; for example, the Lync Server 会议助理应用程序 is actually a service named RTCCAA. The **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet enables you to retrieve detailed information about these Lync Server services and only these services. That’s because the cmdlet has been designed to ignore any service that is not part of Lync Server.

The fact that the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet automatically filters out non-Lync Server services is one advantage the cmdlet offers over the generic **Get-Service** cmdlet that ships as part of Windows PowerShell. In addition to that, there is another reason to use the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet if you need to retrieve information for a Lync Server service: the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet returns useful data that the **Get-Service** cmdlet does not return. For example, when returning information about the Lync Server Conferencing Attendant service, the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet reports back the number of concurrent calls being handled by the service (the service activity level). The **Get-Service** cmdlet does not.

By default the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet runs against the local computer. However, by including the ComputerName parameter you can return information about the Lync Server services running on a remote computer.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins. In addition, you must also be a member of the Performance Monitor Users group on the destination computer in order to run this cmdlet. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$\_.Cmdlets –match "Get-CsWindowsService"}

<p>Note, too that the <strong>Get-CsWindowsService</strong> cmdlet can only return information for Lync Server services; you cannot use this cmdlet to return information for other Windows services.
