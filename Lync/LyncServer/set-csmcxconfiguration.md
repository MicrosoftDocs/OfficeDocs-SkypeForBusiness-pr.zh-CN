# Set-CsMcxConfiguration

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2015-03-09_

Modifies an existing collection of Lync Server Mobility Service configuration settings. The Mobility Service enables users of mobile phones such as iPhones and Windows Phones to do such things as exchange instant messages and presence information; store and retrieve voice mail internally instead of with their wireless provider; and take advantage of Lync capabilities such as Call via Work and dial-out conferencing. 此 cmdlet 是在 2011 年 11 月版的 Lync Server 2010 累积更新中引入的。

## 语法

    Set-CsMcxConfiguration [-Identity <XdsIdentity>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

    Set-CsMcxConfiguration [-Instance <PSObject>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

    COMMON PARAMETERS: [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-ExposedWebURL <External | Internal>] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-PushNotificationProxyUri <String>] [-SessionExpirationInterval <UInt32>] [-SessionShortExpirationInterval <UInt32>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

## Examples

## EXAMPLE 1

In Example 1, the ExposedWebURL property for the Mobility Service configuration settings assigned to the Redmond site is set to External.

    Set-CsMcxConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -ExposedWebURL External

## EXAMPLE 2

Example 2 shows how a single command can assign the same property value to all the Mobility Service configuration settings currently in use in an organization. To do this, the command first uses the **Get-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the existing Mobility Service configuration settings. That collection is then piped to the **Set-CsMcxConfiguration**, which sets the ExposedWebURL property for each item in the collection to External.

    Get-CsMcxConfiguration | Set-CsMcxConfiguration -ExposedWebURL External

## EXAMPLE 3

In Example 3, all the Mobility Service configuration settings that have a SessionShortExpirationInterval of more than 3600 seconds are modified to set that property value to 3600; that effectively makes 3600 seconds the maximum value for all the Mobility Service configuration settings in the organization. To do this, the **Get-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet is first called (without any parameters) in order to return a collection of all the Mobility Service configuration settings currently in use. That collection is then piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which picks out only those settings where the SessionShortExpirationInterval property is greater than (-gt) 3600. This filtered collection is then piped to the **Set-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet, which sets the value of the SessionShortExpirationInterval property for each item in the collection to 3600.

    Get-CsMcxConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.SessionShortExpirationInterval -gt 3600} | Set-CsMcxConfiguration -SessionShortExpirationInterval 3600

## Detailed Description

Lync Server Mobility Service extends many of the capabilities of Lync to mobile devices such as Apple iPhones, Windows Phone, Android phones, and Nokia phones. Among other things, users can use these phones to exchange instant message and presence information, and to receive notifications of new voice mails. Thanks to the push notification service (Apple Push Notification Service and Microsoft Push Notification Service), users with iPhones or Windows Phones can receive these notifications even if Lync Server is running in the background. The Mobility Service also provides the opportunity for organizations to enable Call via Work. With Call via Work, users can make a call from their mobile phone and make it appear as though the call originated from their work phone; for example, Caller ID systems will display the user's work number instead of his or her mobile phone number.

The Mobility Service itself is managed by using Mobility Service configuration settings that can be applied to the global scope, the site scope, or the service scope (for the Web server service only). These settings control such things as the maximum length of time for a Mobility Service session; whether or not the Lync Server Autodiscovery Service (which directs Mobility Service users to the appropriate Registrar pool) is available to users who log on outside the organization's firewall); and the location of the push notification service provider.

The **Set-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet provides a way for administrators to modify any of their existing Mobility Service configuration settings.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **Set-CsMcxConfiguration** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins.
