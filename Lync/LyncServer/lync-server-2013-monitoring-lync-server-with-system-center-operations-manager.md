# Monitoring Lync Server 2013 with System Center Operations Manager

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2016-12-08_

The Lync Server Management Pack (MP) is your monitoring solution of choice for monitoring any Lync Server deployment.

The MP implements traditional Event Log and Performance counter-based instrumentation and enables newly available instrumentation in Lync Server, such as pair events (failure/success) for several Key Health Indicators, and also fully implements the new Synthetic Transactions (Test-Cs\* Windows PowerShell cmdlets).

You can find the Lync Server 2013 Management Pack and its related documentation at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=400468](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=400468). This is recommended if you are running System Center Operations Manager 2012.
