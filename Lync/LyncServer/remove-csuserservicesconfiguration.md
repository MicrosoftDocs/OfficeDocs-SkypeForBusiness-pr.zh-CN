# Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration

 

_**上一次修改主题：** 2015-03-09_

Removes an existing collection of User Services configuration settings. The User Services service is used to help maintain presence information and manage conferencing. 此 cmdlet 是在 Lync Server 2010 中引入的。

## 语法

    Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration -Identity <XdsIdentity> [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

## Examples

## EXAMPLE 1

The command shown in Example 1 removes the User Services configuration settings from the Redmond site (-Identity site:Redmond).

    Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond

## EXAMPLE 2

In Example 2, all the User Services configuration settings that have been applied at the service scope are deleted. To do this, the command calls the **Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet along with the Filter parameter. The filter value "service:\*" limits returned data to settings configured at the service scope (that is, settings that have an Identity that begins with the characters "service:"). This filtered collection is then piped to the **Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet, which deletes each item in the collection.

    Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration -Filter "service:*:" | Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration

## EXAMPLE 3

Example 3 removes all the User Services configuration settings that allow users to have more than 250 contacts. To carry out this task, the command first calls the **Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet without any parameters in order to return a collection of all the User Services configuration settings currently in use. This collection is the piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which selects only those settings where the value of the MaxContacts property is greater than 250. Those settings are then piped to, and removed by, the **Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet.

    Get-CsUserServicesConfiguration | Where-Object {$_.MaxContacts -gt 250} | Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration

## Detailed Description

Lync Server relies on the User Services service to help maintain presence information for users and to manage meetings and conferences. In turn, the **CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlets are used to administer User Services configuration settings at the global, site, and service scope. (Note that the only service that can host User Services configuration settings is the User Services service itself.) These settings help determine such things as the number of contacts a user can have, the number of meetings a user can have scheduled at any one time, and the length of time that a given meeting can remain active.

The **Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet enables you to delete User Services configuration settings that have been applied at the site or service scope. This cmdlet can also be run against the global collection. In that case, however, the global settings will not be deleted; that’s because the global settings cannot be deleted. Instead, all of the properties within the global collection will be reset to their default values. For example, if you have changed the MaxContacts value in the global settings to 500 and then run the **Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet, MaxContacts will be reset to the default value of 250.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself) run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$\_.Cmdlets –match "Remove-CsUserServicesConfiguration"}
