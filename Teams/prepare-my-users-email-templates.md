手机可以是用户的生命线。 从传统电话系统切换到联机电话系统是用户工作方式的重大变化，可能会对工作效率产生负面影响。 花时间通知、指导和支持用户完成此更改有助于确保用户体验积极，并最大限度地提高投资回报。

本文包含可自定义的电子邮件模板，可帮助用户了解其新电话系统。 自定义并发送相应的电子邮件以与特定语音部署保持一致。 我们已使用括号指示可轻松个性化的部分，但我们建议添加特定于组织的消息，以使公告最适用于你的用户。 如果适用于部署，请将对“Teams”的所有引用替换为“Skype for Business”。

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone
```

电子邮件正文：

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can't be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it's easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can't be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use Microsoft Teams as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using Teams as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

When will phone calling be available?

We understand this is a big shift in the way you make calls today and want to
ensure you have everything you need to get started. Phone capabilities will be
enabled on <INSERT DATE>, but you can start preparing today.

CALL TO ACTION

    taking advantage of Teams IM and meetings capabilities, get
    started today by visiting https://aka.ms/F63e30.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your new phone system is live
```

电子邮件正文：

```
Welcome to your new phone system. Your Microsoft Teams application
has been enabled with phone calling capabilities. You should now see a dial pad
tab on your client, enabling you to make outgoing calls and listen to
your voicemail. When a call comes in, you'll receive an alert, just like you
would for an instant message. Just select the alert to answer the call – it's
that easy!

CALL TO ACTION

*  Plug in your headset, go to the Calls tab, and either
   call a contact or use the dial pad to make a call. 

*  Start a chat, and escalate it to a call.

With the launch of phone calling capabilities in Teams, we'll be
recycling your old phone, allowing for more real estate on your desk.
