In such a scenario, one audio stream will have high packet utilization (inbound to the client) while the other will have little to no packet utilization (outbound from the client). In this scenario, the duration of the stream may be an hour or longer but the packet utilization on the stream from the client to the server will be extremely low due to the microphone being muted, resulting in an unclassified stream.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="40cf8-p114">A common low packet utilization scenario occurs when a user joins a meeting to listen to the presenter but never speaks (likely muting the microphone for most of the call).
