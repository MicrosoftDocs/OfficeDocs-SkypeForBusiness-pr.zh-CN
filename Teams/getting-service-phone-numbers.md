description: In addition to getting phone numbers for your users from Office 365, you can search and acquire toll or toll-free phone numbers for services such as audio conferencing (for conference bridges), auto attendants, and call queues (also called service numbers). Service phone numbers have a higher concurrent calling capacity than user or subscriber phone numbers.
