# <a name="upgrade-basic"></a>升级基本信息

升级基本清单是面向小型组织或使用 Skype for Business Online 传递即时消息（聊天）和召开会议的组织的加速行动计划，包括实现成功从 Skype for Business 迁移到 Teams 的核心建议活动及关联资源。

These ten easy steps provide everything you need for a successful upgrade. They’re designed to be completed in about 30 to 45 days, but you should adjust task completion dates based on your organization’s upgrade schedule.

What happens to Skype for Business after the upgrade? After your users are upgraded to Teams (**Teams Only** mode):

- Their Skype for Business client is disabled, and all chat and calls go to Teams. Note that this will not uninstall the client on their desktops.
- 升级之前安排的任何 Skype for Business 会议都将正常进行，但所有新会议都在 Teams 中安排。
- 如果用户尝试登录 Skype for Business，其客户端会发出已升级到 Teams 的通知。
- 用户需要手动卸载其移动设备上的 Skype for Business 客户端。

有关升级的其他问题，请参见我们的[常见问题解答](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-FAQ)。

Not familiar with Teams? [Read about how Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) brings together conversations, meetings, files, Office apps, and third-party integrations—providing a single hub for teamwork in Office 365.

<a name="step-1"></a>

## <a name="step-1-notify-your-key-stakeholders"></a>Step 1. Notify your key stakeholders

*（在升级前的大约四到六周）*

Senior leaders are accountable for company success; be sure to keep them in the know about technology changes. Because it’s possible that not everyone received or read the notification of upgrade eligibility, you need to inform your stakeholders (for example, CEO, IT pros, Marketing, and helpdesk leads) before you begin planning your upgrade.

<a name="step-2"></a>

## <a name="step-2-prepare-your-organization-for-teams"></a>Step 2. Prepare your organization for Teams

*（在升级前的大约四到六周）*

Teams offers compatible Skype for Business functionality—such as IM (chat) and meetings—but it can also do so much more. As a true hub for teamwork, Teams enables workgroups to manage projects, files, conversations, and apps all in one location. Decide how your organization will use Teams and configure your environment for success.

> [!Note]
> As an existing Skype for Business customer, your current network infrastructure is likely already configured for Teams. To confirm this, you can follow the “Complete technical planning” guidance linked to below (this is optional).

<a name="step-3"></a>

## <a name="step-3-know-your-skype-for-business-users"></a>Step 3. Know your Skype for Business users

*（在升级前的大约四周）*

Users who are deeply adopted on Skype for Business might need a little more time or assistance to make the transition to Teams. Take time to review your current Skype for Business usage to identify your top users in need of additional support and to establish a usage baseline you can track against your post-upgrade numbers.

<a name="step-4"></a>

<!--ENDOFSECTION-->

## <a name="step-4-notify-your-users-that-theyll-be-upgrading-from-skype-for-business-to-teams"></a>Step 4. Notify your users that they’ll be upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams

*（在升级前的大约两周到三周）*

Providing ample notice to your users will give them time to get familiar with Teams without negatively affecting their productivity, resulting in a more positive user experience. Send a communication to tell them what’s changing, why it’s changing, and how they can prepare for it.

> [!Note]
> 如果需要，此时可以通过 Office 365 管理门户为你的用户启用 Teams。

<a name="step-5"></a>

## <a name="step-5-activate-the-user-upgrade-notification"></a>Step 5. Activate the user upgrade notification

*（在升级前的大约一周）*

通过以下方法推动升级过程：在管理门户上启用用户升级通知、在 Skype for Business 客户端中提供用户将从 Skype for Business 升级到 Teams 的可视提醒。

<a name="step-6"></a>

## <a name="step-6-remind-your-users-that-theyll-be-upgrading-from-skype-for-business-to-teams"></a>Step 6. Remind your users that they’ll be upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams

*（在升级前的大约五天）*

Users are busy with their daily responsibilities. Reminding them of the pending upgrade will help ensure they remember to take the steps they need to prepare for Teams. This is the perfect time to remind users about available training and how to get started with Teams.

<a name="step-7"></a>

<!--ENDOFSECTION-->

## <a name="step-7-upgrade-users-to-teams"></a>Step 7. Upgrade users to Teams!

*（升级当天）*

Today is the day your organization officially upgrades to Teams as your communication and collaboration solution. In the Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center, activate the upgrade switch by setting the coexistence mode to **Teams Only**. (In the admin center, go to **Org-wide Settings** > **Teams Upgrade**.) Users will receive a notification in their Skype for Business client that they’ve been upgraded to Teams.

我们建议在所有人都升级后，发送一封欢迎大家使用 Teams 的电子邮件。

<a name="step-8"></a>

## <a name="step-8-monitor-teams-usage-against-your-baseline"></a>Step 8. Monitor Teams usage against your baseline

*（在升级后的大约一周或两周）*

Adjusting to a new technology can take some time. Check usage to verify that users are using Teams at the same—or greater—level as they did with Skype for Business. Check in with users who aren’t using Teams at expected levels.

*（在升级后的大约一周或两周）*
