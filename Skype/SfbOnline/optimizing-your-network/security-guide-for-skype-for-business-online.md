The first step in creating a more secure unified communications system was to design threat models and test each feature as it was designed. Multiple security-related improvements were built into the coding process and practices. Build-time tools detect buffer overruns and other potential security threats before the code is checked in to the final product. Of course, it is impossible to design against all unknown security threats. No system can guarantee complete security.

### <a name="eavesdropping"></a><span data-ttu-id="87cac-134">窃听</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-134">Eavesdropping</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p107">在攻击者获取对网络中数据路径的访问权并能够监控和读取流量内容时，会发生窃听。窃听也称为监听或窥探。如果流量内容采用纯文本形式，则攻击者在获取路径的访问权之后即可读取流量内容。例如，通过控制数据路径上的路由器进行攻击。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p107">Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic. This is also called sniffing or snooping. If the traffic is in plain text, the attacker can read the traffic when the attacker gains access to the path. An example is an attack performed by controlling a router on the data path.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked. TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. This does not prevent eavesdropping, but the attacker cannot read the traffic unless the encryption is broken.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked.

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so. A successful attack allows the attacker to operate as if the attacker is the entity normally identified by the IP address. Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so.

Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="87cac-151">已配置仅支持传输控制协议 (TCP) 的连接（建议不要这样做，因为 TCP 通信未经过加密）。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-151">Configured connections that support only Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (which is not recommended, because TCP communications are unencrypted).</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. Using TLS prevents an attacker from performing IP address spoofing on a specific connection (for example, mutual TLS connections). But an attacker could still spoof the address of the DNS server that SfBO uses. However, because authentication in SfBO is performed with certificates, an attacker would not have a valid certificate required to spoof one of the parties in the communication.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic.

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. This can happen if an attacker can modify Active Directory Domain Services to add his or her server as a trusted server or modify Domain Name System (DNS) to get clients to connect through the attacker on their way to the server.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users.

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-162">中间人攻击还可能发生在两个客户端之间的媒体流量中，但在 SfBO 中点对点音频、视频和应用程序共享流使用基于 TLS 的会话启动协议 (SIP) 在对等设备之间协商的加密密钥通过 SRTP 进行加密。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-162">A man-in-the-middle attack can also occur with media traffic between two clients, except that in SfBO point-to-point audio, video, and application sharing streams are encrypted with SRTP, using cryptographic keys that are negotiated between the peers using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over TLS.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes. SfBO uses SRTP in conjunction with a secure signaling protocol that protects transmissions from replay attacks by enabling the receiver to maintain an index of already received RTP packets and compare each new packet with those already listed in the index.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes.

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p114">Spim 是主动提供的商业即时消息或状态订阅请求。虽然 Spim 本身并不会导致网络问题，但至少会有些烦人，占用资源和生产时间，而且可能会导致网络问题。例如，用户通过发送请求相互发送垃圾消息。用户可以相互阻止对方来防止出现这种情况，但对于联盟，如果建立了协作的 Spim 攻击，则很难防止出现这种情况，除非你禁用联盟伙伴关系。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p114">Spim is unsolicited commercial instant messages or presence subscription requests. While not by itself a compromise of the network, it is annoying in the least, can reduce resource availability and production, and can possibly lead to a compromise of the network. An example of this is users spimming each other by sending requests. Users can block each other to prevent this, but with federation, if a coordinated spim attack is established, this can be difficult to overcome unless you disable federation for the partner.</span></span>

The Windows Server public key infrastructure (PKI) provides the infrastructure for establishing and validating this chain of trust. Certificates are digital IDs. They identify a server by name and specify its properties. To ensure that the information on a certificate is valid, the certificate must be issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by clients or other servers that connect to the server. If the server connects only with other clients and servers on a private network, the CA can be an enterprise CA. If the server interacts with entities outside the private network, a public CA might be required.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p122">SfBO service relies on certificates for server authentication and to establish a chain of trust between clients and servers and among the different server roles.

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p126">TLS and MTLS protocols provide encrypted communications and endpoint authentication on the Internet.

<span data-ttu-id="87cac-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect. On a TLS connection, the client requests a valid certificate from the server. To be valid, the certificate must have been issued by a CA that is also trusted by the client and the DNS name of the server must match the DNS name on the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the client uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt the symmetric encryption keys to be used for the communication, so only the original owner of the certificate can use its private key to decrypt the contents of the communication. The resulting connection is trusted and from that point is not challenged by other trusted servers or clients. Within this context, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as used with Web services can be associated as TLS-based.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="87cac-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect.

A client uses these two ports to allocate UDP and TCP ports respectively for the remote party to connect to. To access the A/V Edge service, the client must first have established an authenticated SIP signaling session with SfBO registrar to obtain A/V Edge service authentication credentials. These values are sent across the TLS-protected signaling channel and are computer generated to mitigate against dictionary attacks. Clients can then use these credentials for digest authentication with the A/V Edge service to allocate ports for use in a media session. An initial allocate request is sent from the client and responded with a 401 nonce/challenge message from the A/V Edge service. The client sends a second allocate containing the user name and a Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) hash of the user name and nonce.</span></span>

Good security practice is to always minimize the total number of listening ports by not running unnecessary network services. If a network service is not running, it is not exploitable by a remote attacker and the surface of attack of the host computer is reduced. However, within a single service, reducing the number of ports does not provide the same benefit. The A/V Edge service software is no more exposed to attack with 10,000 ports open as it is with 10.
