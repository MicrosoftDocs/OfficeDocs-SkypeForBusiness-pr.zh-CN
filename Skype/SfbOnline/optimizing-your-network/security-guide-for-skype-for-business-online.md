The first step in creating a more secure unified communications system was to design threat models and test each feature as it was designed. Multiple security-related improvements were built into the coding process and practices. Build-time tools detect buffer overruns and other potential security threats before the code is checked in to the final product. Of course, it is impossible to design against all unknown security threats. No system can guarantee complete security.

### <a name="compromised-key-attack"></a><span data-ttu-id="81a4b-119">被盗用密钥攻击</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-119">Compromised-Key Attack</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p104">密钥是用于加密、解密或验证机密信息的机密代码或数字。必须考虑的公钥基础结构（PKI）中使用两个敏感密钥：每个证书持有者具有的私钥以及通信合作伙伴成功识别和会话密钥交换后使用的会话密钥。攻击者确定私钥或会话密钥时会发生受损密钥攻击。当攻击者成功确定密钥时，攻击者可以使用密钥解密加密的数据，而不知道发件人的知识。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p104">A key is a secret code or number that is used to encrypt, decrypt, or validate secret information. There are two sensitive keys in use in public key infrastructure (PKI) that must be considered: the private key that each certificate holder has and the session key that is used after a successful identification and session key exchange by the communicating partners. A compromised-key attack occurs when the attacker determines the private key or the session key. When the attacker is successful in determining the key, the attacker can use the key to decrypt encrypted data without the knowledge of the sender.</span></span>

- <span data-ttu-id="81a4b-129">向受到攻击的网络中正在运行的应用程序和服务发送无效数据，干扰它们的正常工作。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-129">Send invalid data to applications and services running in the attacked network to disrupt their normal function.</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="81a4b-130">发送大量流量以造成系统过载，直到系统停止对合理请求做出响应或对合理请求做出响应的速度变得很慢。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-130">Send a large amount of traffic, overloading the system until it stops responding or responds slowly to legitimate requests.</span></span>

- <span data-ttu-id="81a4b-132">阻止用户访问网络资源。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-132">Prevent users from accessing network resources.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-133">SfBO 通过运行 Azure DDOS 网络保护和限制来自相同终结点、子网和联合实体的客户端请求来减少这些攻击。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-133">SfBO mitigates against these attacks by running Azure DDOS network protection and by throttling client requests from the same endpoints, subnets, and federated entities.</span></span>

### <a name="eavesdropping"></a><span data-ttu-id="81a4b-134">窃听</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-134">Eavesdropping</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p107">在攻击者获取对网络中数据路径的访问权并能够监控和读取流量内容时，会发生窃听。窃听也称为监听或窥探。如果流量内容采用纯文本形式，则攻击者在获取路径的访问权之后即可读取流量内容。例如，通过控制数据路径上的路由器进行攻击。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p107">Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic. This is also called sniffing or snooping. If the traffic is in plain text, the attacker can read the traffic when the attacker gains access to the path. An example is an attack performed by controlling a router on the data path.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p108">SfBO 使用相互 TLS （MTLS）来实现 Microsoft 365 或 Office 365 中的服务器通信和从客户端到服务的 TLS，因此在给定对话可能遭受攻击的时段内，呈现此攻击很难实现。TLS 对所有方进行身份验证，并加密所有通信。这不会阻止窃听，但攻击者无法读取流量，除非加密已损坏。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked. TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. This does not prevent eavesdropping, but the attacker cannot read the traffic unless the encryption is broken.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p109">TURN 协议用于实时媒体用途。TURN 协议不要求加密通信，并且它正在发送的信息受消息完整性保护。尽管它是开放的，但通过查看数据包的源地址和目标地址即可直接提取发送的信息（即 IP 地址和端口）。SfBO 服务通过检查邮件的消息完整性来确保数据的有效性，方法是使用从一些项目派生的密钥，包括一个密码，这些项目从不以明文形式发送。SRTP 用于媒体流量，也是加密的。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p109">The TURN protocol is used for real time media purposes. The TURN protocol does not mandate the traffic to be encrypted and the information that it is sending is protected by message integrity. Although it is open to eavesdropping, the information it is sending (that is, IP addresses and port) can be extracted directly by simply looking at the source and destination addresses of the packets. The SfBO service ensures that the data is valid by checking the Message Integrity of the message using the key derived from a few items including a TURN password, which is never sent in clear text. SRTP is used for media traffic and is also encrypted.</span></span>

### <a name="identity-spoofing-ip-address-spoofing"></a><span data-ttu-id="81a4b-147">标识欺骗（IP 地址欺骗）</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-147">Identity Spoofing (IP Address Spoofing)</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so. A successful attack allows the attacker to operate as if the attacker is the entity normally identified by the IP address. Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so. A successful attack allows the attacker to operate as if the attacker is the entity normally identified by the IP address. Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="81a4b-151">已配置仅支持传输控制协议 (TCP) 的连接（建议不要这样做，因为 TCP 通信未经过加密）。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-151">Configured connections that support only Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (which is not recommended, because TCP communications are unencrypted).</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="81a4b-152">将这些连接的 IP 地址标记为受信任的主机。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-152">Marked the IP addresses of those connections as trusted hosts.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. Using TLS prevents an attacker from performing IP address spoofing on a specific connection (for example, mutual TLS connections). But an attacker could still spoof the address of the DNS server that SfBO uses. However, because authentication in SfBO is performed with certificates, an attacker would not have a valid certificate required to spoof one of the parties in the communication.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic.

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. This can happen if an attacker can modify Active Directory Domain Services to add his or her server as a trusted server or modify Domain Name System (DNS) to get clients to connect through the attacker on their way to the server.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users.

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-162">中间人攻击还可能发生在两个客户端之间的媒体流量中，但在 SfBO 中点对点音频、视频和应用程序共享流使用基于 TLS 的会话启动协议 (SIP) 在对等设备之间协商的加密密钥通过 SRTP 进行加密。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-162">A man-in-the-middle attack can also occur with media traffic between two clients, except that in SfBO point-to-point audio, video, and application sharing streams are encrypted with SRTP, using cryptographic keys that are negotiated between the peers using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over TLS.</span></span> 

### <a name="rtp-replay-attack"></a><span data-ttu-id="81a4b-163">RTP 重放攻击</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-163">RTP Replay Attack</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes. SfBO uses SRTP in conjunction with a secure signaling protocol that protects transmissions from replay attacks by enabling the receiver to maintain an index of already received RTP packets and compare each new packet with those already listed in the index.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes.

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p114">Spim 是主动提供的商业即时消息或状态订阅请求。虽然 Spim 本身并不会导致网络问题，但至少会有些烦人，占用资源和生产时间，而且可能会导致网络问题。例如，用户通过发送请求相互发送垃圾消息。用户可以相互阻止对方来防止出现这种情况，但对于联盟，如果建立了协作的 Spim 攻击，则很难防止出现这种情况，除非你禁用联盟伙伴关系。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p114">Spim is unsolicited commercial instant messages or presence subscription requests. While not by itself a compromise of the network, it is annoying in the least, can reduce resource availability and production, and can possibly lead to a compromise of the network. An example of this is users spimming each other by sending requests. Users can block each other to prevent this, but with federation, if a coordinated spim attack is established, this can be difficult to overcome unless you disable federation for the partner.</span></span>

### <a name="viruses-and-worms"></a><span data-ttu-id="81a4b-171">病毒与蠕虫</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-171">Viruses and Worms</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p115">病毒是一种代码单元，其用途是重现其他类似的代码单元。若要工作，病毒需要一个主机，例如文件、电子邮件或程序。与病毒一样，蠕虫是编码为再现其他类似代码单元的代码单元，但与病毒不需要主机。病毒和蠕虫主要在客户端之间的文件传输期间或从其他用户发送 Url 时显示。如果您的计算机上有病毒，则可以使用您的身份，并以您的名义发送即时消息。标准客户端安全最佳做法（如定期扫描病毒）可缓解此问题。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p115">A virus is a unit of code whose purpose is to reproduce additional, similar code units. To work, a virus needs a host, such as a file, email, or program. Like a virus, a worm is a unit of code that is coded to reproduce additional, similar code units, but that unlike a virus does not need a host. Viruses and worms primarily show up during file transfers between clients or when URLs are sent from other users. If a virus is on your computer, it can, for example, use your identity and send instant messages on your behalf. Standard client security best practices such as periodically scanning for viruses can mitigate this issue.</span></span>

The Windows Server public key infrastructure (PKI) provides the infrastructure for establishing and validating this chain of trust. Certificates are digital IDs. They identify a server by name and specify its properties. To ensure that the information on a certificate is valid, the certificate must be issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by clients or other servers that connect to the server. If the server connects only with other clients and servers on a private network, the CA can be an enterprise CA.

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p126">TLS and MTLS protocols provide encrypted communications and endpoint authentication on the Internet.

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect. On a TLS connection, the client requests a valid certificate from the server. To be valid, the certificate must have been issued by a CA that is also trusted by the client and the DNS name of the server must match the DNS name on the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the client uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt the symmetric encryption keys to be used for the communication, so only the original owner of the certificate can use its private key to decrypt the contents of the communication. The resulting connection is trusted and from that point is not challenged by other trusted servers or clients. Within this context, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as used with Web services can be associated as TLS-based.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect.

TLS and SfBO’s specification of trusted servers mitigate the risk of a man-in-the middle attack partially on the application layer by using end-to-end encryption coordinated using the Public Key cryptography between the two endpoints, and an attacker would have to have a valid and trusted certificate with the corresponding private key and issued to the name of the service to which the client is communicating to decrypt the communication.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p129">TLS and MTLS help prevent both eavesdropping and man-in-the middle attacks.

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p142">客户端使用 UDP 3478-3481 和 TCP 443 端口从 A/V 边缘服务请求服务。客户端使用这两个端口分别分配 UDP 和 TCP 端口，以便远程方连接。若要访问 A/V 边缘服务，客户端必须首先建立与 SfBO 注册机构的经过身份验证的 SIP 信号会话，以获取 A/V 边缘服务身份验证凭据。这些值通过受 TLS 保护的信号通道发送，并由计算机生成以减少词典攻击。然后，客户可以使用这些凭据进行摘要式身份验证，使用 A/V 边缘服务分配端口以在媒体会话中使用。初始分配请求从客户端发送，并通过 A/V 边缘服务中的 401 nonce/质询消息进行响应。客户端发送第二个分配，其中包含用户名和 nonce 的用户名称和哈希消息身份验证代码（HMAC）哈希。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p142">The UDP 3478-3481 and TCP 443 ports are used by clients to request service from the A/V Edge service. A client uses these two ports to allocate UDP and TCP ports respectively for the remote party to connect to. To access the A/V Edge service, the client must first have established an authenticated SIP signaling session with SfBO registrar to obtain A/V Edge service authentication credentials. These values are sent across the TLS-protected signaling channel and are computer generated to mitigate against dictionary attacks. Clients can then use these credentials for digest authentication with the A/V Edge service to allocate ports for use in a media session. An initial allocate request is sent from the client and responded with a 401 nonce/challenge message from the A/V Edge service. The client sends a second allocate containing the user name and a Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) hash of the user name and nonce.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="81a4b-p143">A sequence number mechanism is also in place to prevent replay attacks. The server calculates the expected HMAC based on its own knowledge of the user name and password and if the HMAC values match, the allocate procedure is carried out. Otherwise, the packet is dropped. This same HMAC mechanism is also applied to subsequent messages within this call session. The lifetime of this user name/password value is a maximum of eight hours at which time the client reacquires a new user name/password for subsequent calls.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="81a4b-p143">A sequence number mechanism is also in place to prevent replay attacks.

Because the A/V Edge service is the sole process using these ports, the size of the port range does not indicate the potential surface of attack. Good security practice is to always minimize the total number of listening ports by not running unnecessary network services. If a network service is not running, it is not exploitable by a remote attacker and the surface of attack of the host computer is reduced. However, within a single service, reducing the number of ports does not provide the same benefit. The A/V Edge service software is no more exposed to attack with 10,000 ports open as it is with 10.
