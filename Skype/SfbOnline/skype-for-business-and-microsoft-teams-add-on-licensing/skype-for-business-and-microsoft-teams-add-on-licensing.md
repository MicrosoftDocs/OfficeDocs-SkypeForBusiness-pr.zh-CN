## <a name="what-are-add-on-licenses"></a>什么是附加许可证？

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams features. 某些企业希望以有竞争力的价格灵活地购买特定功能。 To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licensing is designed to give you the maximum amount of flexibility. For example, after using basic Skype for Business features for a while, you can buy add-on licenses when you're ready to use more features, such as Audio Conferencing, or the Phone System in Office 365.

## <a name="how-does-add-on-licensing-affect-cost"></a>How does add-on licensing affect cost?

对于大多数企业，购买企业版计划中的一系列软件将降低总成本。 Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with higher combined cost.

For more cost information, see [How to see prices and buy add-on licenses](skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_how) or one of the following:

## <a name="what-features-can-i-get-with-add-on-licenses"></a>有了附加许可证，我可以获得哪些功能？

Depending on which plan you already have, you can buy add-on licenses for the following Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams features:
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**功能** <br/> |**说明** <br/> |
|**音频会议** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meeting, instead of using their computer. Use the Audio Conferencing feature for this situation.  <br/> To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/audio-conferencing#requirements).  <br/> |
|**用于拨入会议的免费电话号码，以及通过呼叫世界各地的任何电话号码从会议拨出以添加其他人的功能** <br/> |If you add Audio Conferencing, we recommend that you [Set up Communications Credits](set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |
|**Phone System** <br/> |A PBX is a telephone system in a business. Phone System in Office 365 is a hosted telephone service in Office 365. It gives you both traditional and innovative PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. [Here's what you get with Phone System in Office 365](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md).  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Phone System](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/cloud-pbx#requirements).  <br/> |
|**Calling Plans** <br/> |Calls to other Skype for Business users are free, but if you want your users to be able to call any phone numbers outside of your business, get a [Calling Plan](calling-plans-for-office-365.md). There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans in Office 365.  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Calling Plans](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/pstn-calling-plans#requirements).  <br/> |
|**Skype 会议室系统第 2 版** <br/> |这不是加载项，而是一项可将视频、音频和内容共享带入会议室的功能。 See [Skype Room Systems v2](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/license-options-based-on-your-plan/skype-room-systems-v2.md).  <br/> |

## <a name="how-to-see-prices-and-buy-add-on-licenses"></a>如何查看价格并购买附加许可证
<a name="bkmk_how"> </a>

 **购买 Office 365 计划后，可通过 Office 365 管理中心** 查看价格和购买附加许可证。
  
根据你所需要的附加许可证，我们建议你[比较一下更改为已经包含这些功能的某项计划是否更加划算](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844053)。

See your plan under "License options based on your plan" for more details about which licenses to buy and how to see prices and purchase add-on licenses. 

## <a name="how-do-i-use-my-existing-calling-plans-with-skype-for-business"></a>How do I use my existing Calling Plans with Skype for Business?
<a name="bkmk_existing"></a>

If you want to use your existing Calling Plan, buy the **Phone System** add-on and use it with the **[free Cloud connector](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt605227.aspx)**.
  
If you are using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users, you  *only*  assign **Phone System** licenses to your users. **DO NOT** also assign a Calling Plan.
  
For extensive documentation on planning your deployment, including Phone System with on-premises PSTN connectivity, see [Plan your Phone System in Office 365 (Cloud PBX) solution](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt612869.aspx).
